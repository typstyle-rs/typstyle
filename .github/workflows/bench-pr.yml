name: Benchmark for PR
# This workflow runs benchmarks in parallel jobs with caching for performance.
# Base benchmarks use the upstream repository to ensure base revision exists.
# PR benchmarks use the fork repository for the head revision.
# Results are compared in a final job using artifacts for reliable data transfer.
